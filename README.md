## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 16+**, and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io).

We also recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) to help switch between repos using different package managers. `ni` also provides the handy `nr` command which running npm scripts easier.

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ pnpm i # install the dependencies of the project
```
